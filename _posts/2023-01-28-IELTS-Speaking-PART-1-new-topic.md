### The space and the stars

**Have you ever learned anything about apace and the stars when you were at school? **

> Yes. I have learned a lot about space and the stars while I was at school. We were taught about the  solar system in primary school and after that I had a huge interest in physics and astronomy. 

**Would you like to know out more about space and the stars? **

> I am always interested in finding out more about space and the stars. The universe is so unknown and  there is always more to learn so I am excited by any new findings published by astronomers. I  subscribe to many physics journals and magazines about space. 

> I have no desire to learn more about space and the stars. In my opinion, there is no point to learning  about it. We live on planet earth and for millions of light years around us there is no other life in the  universe, so what is the point of learning about a bunch of lifeless rocks? 

**Do you like science-fiction movies set in space? **

> I am a big fan of watching science fiction films set in space. I have watched every movie and TV  show in the Star Wars franchise and I am always looking for new content. I am currently very excited  by the recent Dune films. 

> I detest sci-fi movies and really dislike the ones set in space. I prefer realism and historical movies. I  like watching things I can relate to and I find films set in outer space far too alienating for me to  enjoy them properly. 

**Do you want to go into outer space in the future? **

> Outer space is very scary but it would be a mind-blowing experience to visit outer space. To see the  earth from outer space has been described by so many astronauts as a life changing experience. I  would like to have that experience myself one day. 

> Why would I ever want to go into outer space? Outer space is one of the most inhospitable places we  know in the universe. It is cold, dark, and a total vacuum with no oxygen. I would be terrified the  entire time I was in outer space and I would not enjoy it at all. 

### Small businesses

**Are there many small businesses where you live? **

> Where I live there are many small businesses. I live in a part of the city where business is local and people like to support the community. Therefore, small businesses thrive[θraɪv] here. 

> There are not too many small businesses where I live. I live in a very central part of the city where the streets are dominated by international brands and large businesses. It is simply too expensive around here for small businesses to afford the rent.

**Have you ever worked for a small business? **

>Yes, I have worked for a small business before, in fact, my first job was with a small business. I think it is nice to work for small companies as the team all know each other very well and there is a good working relationship. 

> No, I have never worked for a small business. Because small businesses are small they do not hire a  lot of people. Small businesses are made up of a small handful of people and sometimes people who  all know each other already like a family business. 

**Would you like to start your own small business in the future? **

>It is a dream of mine to start my own small business one day. I want to own a business that brings  jobs and money to my community. I think that is a very prestigious and respectable role to have in  society.

> I don’t think I would like to start my on small business one day. That seems like a lot of stress and  uncertainty. It is hard to make a business work and to make it profitable. I would rather just earn a  good salary from a large company. 

**Do you prefer to buy things from a large company or small business? **

> I prefer to buy things from small businesses. I think it is much nicer to give your money to people in  your community and to people who will also spend money in the community. The people who own  large companies are rich enough. 

> Personally, I prefer buying things from large companies rather than small businesses.  Large companies are always able to offer you the most competitive prices. Also, these companies  normally have decades of experience in what they do so their products are good quality. 

### Key

**Do you often carry lots of keys with you? **

> Yes, I usually carry a lot of keys with me. There are so many keys I need on a daily basis. I have my  room key, the key to my building, my locker key at school and my locker key at the gym. And these  are on a chain with all my other random keys. 

>I try my best not to carry a lot of keys with me. I find that keys are cumbersome and can be annoying  to carry in your pocket. They are uncomfortable and can make a lot of noise when they jangle.  Therefore, I try to only take out the keys I need like my housekey. 

**Do you often forget to take keys with you? **

> I rarely forget to take my keys with me when I go. There are so many important keys I have that I  need to use on a daily basis. Therefore, it would be detrimental if I ever left my keys at home. 

> I quite frequently forget to take my keys with me when I leave the house. There are so many things I  have to remember to take that it is easy to forget one! Luckily, I live with a group of flat mates so  there is always someone to let me in when I have forgotten my keys. 

**Have you ever lost any keys? **

> I have only ever lost my keys once and that was when I was quite young, in fact it was my first set of  keys. When I was 12 years old my parents entrusted me with a set of keys for the house. I left them in  a park and was severely punished. 

> Oh I have lost many sets of keys! I am quite a forgetful and careless person. So, I will leave my keys  in cafes, on the bus, at the university, all over the place. Sometimes, I lose my keys and I have no idea  where I have even lost them! 

**Do you think it’s a good idea to leave a home key with a neighbor? **

> Personally, I think it is not a good idea to leave a key to your home with a neighbour. I think it is  more important to be responsible with your keys and self-reliant. People should not start bothering  their neighbours when they are locked out! 

> I think it is an excellent idea to leave a home key with a neighbour. You never know when you might  forget your key at home or lose your key somewhere in the city. It costs hundreds of yuan to get a  locksmith out to unlock your door for you. It is much better and cheaper to leave a key with your  neighbour. 

### T-shirts

**How often do you wear T-shirts? **

>I wear T-shirts very often as I think they are a convenient and comfortable item of clothing. I own a  lot of T-shirts, some plain, some multicoloured, and some with designs. I find you can wear T-shirts  for many different occasions. 

> I seldom wear T-shirts as I am more frequently dressed in slightly more formal wear. I have nothing  against T-shirts in general but during my work and studies I think it is appropriate to wear a proper  buttoned shirt. Then, during the weekends I normally wear things slightly more high-fashion than  T-shirts. 

**Do you like T-shirts which have pictures on them? **

> I like T-shirts with pictures on them. I think T-shirts with pictures are a good way for people to  express their interests and identity. Some T-shirts have musical designs, some are merchandise from  films and TV, and some just have silly designs and drawings. 

> I abhor T-shirts with pictures on them, I think they are silly and childish. Fashion is very important to  me and I think they way that a person presents themselves through fashion says a lot. T-shirts with  pictures on them are very unserious and immature. 

**How fashionable are T-shirts for older generations in your country? **

> T-shirts are even fashionable with older people in my country. For one, T-shirts have been  fashionable for many decades now so it is not surprising that older people like to wear them.  Moreover, T-shirts are comfortable, easy to wear, and convenient, which is suitable for the elderly. 

> T-shirts are considered very unfashionable for the older generations in my country. This doesn’t  surprise me at all. Older people grew up in a time where everyone was dressed a little more seriously  and sensibly. People would wear proper shirts every day. So, T-shirts are very unpopular with the  elderly here. 

**Have you ever bought a T-shirt as a souvenir from a vacation? **

> Yes, I have bought a T-shirt as a souvenir from a holiday, I have done it multiple times in fact. I think  tourist locations often have funny and interesting T-shirts which make good souvenirs. One of my  favourite T-shirts is one that I bought at Anna, Disneyland, Yasi, when I went to Paris with my  family. 

> No, I have never wasted money on a T-shirt as a memento from a vacation. I think there are far finer  and classier souvenirs than a T-shirt. You can buy wonderful postcards, magnets, notebooks, even tea  towels with wonderful designs and pictures. I will always buy these over a T-shirt. 

### Weekends

**Is the weekend your favourite part of the week? **

> The weekend is by far my favourite part of the week. I am not the sort of person who loves to work  or study. I like to have fun and hang out with my friends, which is what the weekends were made for! 

> Honestly, the weekend is not my favourite part of the week. I really enjoy my week days! I have a job  I love and I study a degree that interests me. And most weekdays I spend the evenings out to dinner  with my friends before I go home. My weekends I use to do grocery shopping and laundry, they are  kind of boring! 

**What did you do last weekend?**

> Last weekend I tried out a new restaurant in Beijing with my friends. We went to Choy’s Seafood  Restaurant, which is a highly recommended restaurant with great reviews! We had an incredible meal  and we will definitely go back another weekend. AnnaYasi. 

> Honestly, last weekend was the same as most of my weekends and wasn’t very interesting. On the  Saturday I went out to the local supermarket and bought my weekly groceries, I then went home a  prepared my lunches for the following week. On Sunday I did my laundry and cleaned my house. 

**Do you like to plan how to spend your weekends? **

> I like to plan how I spend my weekends. There is always so much I want to do, so many people to see,  and so many places to go to. If I do not make a plan I will become overwhelmed and end up missing  out on things that I want to do! 

> I do not really need to plan how I spend my weekends as I normally spend them in a pretty similar  way. I know that in general I am going to do my shopping and do my cleaning but I do not feel the  need to plan it out meticulously. I try to be quite relaxed at the weekends so I don’t follow plans. 

**Do you ever work or study at the weekends? **

> I do not ever work or study at the weekends. I think it is very important to have a clear division  between work time and personal time. I will only work or study on weekdays and even on weekdays I  do not work or study in the evening. 

>I frequently study and work at the weekends. I use my weekends to complete my reproductive labour  and ensure that I have food and clothes for the following week. This often leaves me with quite a bit  of free time during the weekends which sometimes I use to work or study. 

### Sports

**Did you often do sports when you were at school? **

> When I was at school I did a lot of sport. I was always a very competitive person at school and on top  of that I had quite an athletic build. Because of this I was always the favourite for sport’s teams. I  played soccer, basketball, tennis, and did long distance running. 

> I very rarely did sports when I was at school. I must admit that when at school I did not have the  most athletic build. I was slightly overweight and not very strong. So, I was not good at sports at all  and I did not have fun playing them. Therefore, I avoided sport in general. 

**What was your favourite sport when you were at school? **

> When I was at school my favourite sport was soccer. At my school, soccer was the most popular sport.  Everybody wanted to be on the team and those of us who were on the team all became very close  friends. There is so much teamwork and sportsmanship involved in football. 

> To be honest, I did not have a favourite sport because I hated almost every sport I played. But, if I had  to pick one I would say my favourite was running. The only reason for this is that at least running  was not a team sport so there were no teammates I could disappoint. 

**Is it important for children to do sport at school? **

> I think it is very important for children to do sport at school. Across the world, childhood obesity is  becoming a rampant problem. I think one of the reasons for this is that children don’t exercise  properly. This is why it is so important for children to do sports at school. 

> I think people often overvalue the importance of children doing sport at school. Sure, it is important  for children to exercise but that isn’t necessarily something they should have to do at school. School  should be about study and learning. Sport just creates unhealthy competition between students. 

**Were any of your school friends very good at sport? **

> Loads of my school friends were very good at sports. I was on a lot of the school sports teams so  most of my friends were people from these teams. Because of this, most of my friends are athletic,  sporty types. 

> No, the majority of my friends were not very athletic or sporty people. I was more interested in music  and art at school so most of my friends were talented musicians and artists but I must say very few of  them were proficient at sport. 

### Jewelry

**Do you often wear jewelry? **

> I wear jewelry probably most days of the week, I definitely wear it every weekend. I love to  accessorize and I consider myself to have a good fashion sense. I am normally wearing a couple of  rings or a necklace as part of my outfit. At the weekends I like to put on a lot of jewelry when I go  out. 

> I seldom wear jewelry as I believe it is flashy and ostentatious. I don’t like drawing attention to  myself and prefer to go unnoticed in a crowd so I do not like wearing bright and eye-grabbing items  of jewelry. I will only wear jewelry on very special occasions such as attending a wedding. 

**What kind of jewelry do you like to buy? **

> I like to buy good high quality jewelry but I do not need items that cost thousands of dollars. I know  some people like very expensive jewelry but for me as long as it is well made, and I think it is pretty,  then it is good enough for me. 

> As I rarely buy or wear jewelry I think it is appropriate that when I do buy jewelry it is expensive,  fine-quality jewelry. I will only wear my jewelry a handful of times a year and to very significant  events so it is important to me that I am wearing the best jewelry that money can buy. 

**Have you ever bought jewelry for other people? **

> Yes, I have bought jewelry for someone else, I do it quite often. I think jewelry makes a wonderful  gift and I believe myself to have a very good taste in jewelry. So I have bought jewelry as a gift for  my friends and family, especially for my mother. My gifts are always well received. 

> No, I do not ever buy jewelry for other people. I believe that jewelry is something very important and  very special. Therefore, I think it is only appropriate to buy jewelry for people you love the most in  the world, such as a husband or wife. So, I only buy jewelry for myself at the moment. 

**Why do you think some people keep a piece of jewelry for a long time? **

> I think some people keep a piece of jewelry for a long time because it is very easy to attach  sentimental value to jewelry. I think most people become attached to jewelry and will associate it  with an important moment, a special place, or with a person they love. This is why they will keep it  for a long time. 

> People keep a piece of jewelry for a long time because jewelry is expensive. In some ways, a lot of  jewelry is like an investment. A very expensive piece of jewelry can be kept and passed down  through the generations, to be sold if anyone ever desperately needs money. 

### Being happy

**What things made you happy when you were a child? **

> When I was a child I was always happiest when playing with my friends or with my pets. I loved  animals as a child and I had a pet dog who was the most playful dog I have ever known. My friends  and I would take him to the park and run around and play fetch. They were my happiest moments. 

> When I was a child, the thing that made me the happiest was honestly just playing video games. It  may seem like a silly answer but I found video games so exciting. I would play them with my little  sister and we would have so much fun fighting dragons, solving puzzles, and completing challenges.

**Do you feel happy when you buy something new? **

> I do not always feel happy when I buy something new. To be honest, I am not the kind of person who  is into retail therapy. I buy things when I need them and I try to be sensible in my purchases.  Therefore, buying something new doesn’t make me feel particularly happy. 

>I must admit, I am quite the shopaholic, and I always feel ecstatic when I purchase a new item. I love  going to the mall or surfing the web looking the best deal or the hottest new items. It makes me so  happy to receive the new item and to use it for the first time! 

**What makes you feel happiest in your studies now? **

> What makes me feel happiest in my studies is when I overcome a particularly tricky problem.  Sometimes I will be set a task by my boss/professor that I have to complete by a tight deadline. At  first this is stressful but I rise to the challenge and I am so happy when I overcome it! 

> I would say that the thing that makes me happiest in my studies now are the friends I have made and  the people I have met. During my studies I have been exposed to some brilliant researchers and  professionals. Meeting these impressive people is always exciting and fills me with joy. I also cherish  all the friends I have made along the way. 

**What do you think will bring you happiness in the future? **

>I think my future successes will bring me happiness in the future. I am a very ambitious person, and I  am driven to succeed and prove myself in all aspects of my life. I look forward to excelling in my job,  in my relationships and in my personal growth. I think this will bring me a lot of happiness. 

> I think a good social life and a good family life will bring me happiness in the future. I strongly  believe that the most important thing in life is the people who around you. I look forward to having a  close group of friends and a strong family unit to support me through all the ups and downs life has to  bring. 

### Art

**Which one do you like, modern art or traditional art? **

> I prefer traditional art to modern art. Personally, I think that modern art is very confusing and a lot of  the time I cannot tell the difference between the work of a famous modern artist and the drawings of  a five year old child. I believe that traditional artists have far more skill, discipline, and craft. 

>I have always really liked modern art. I think modern art is daring and exciting. You never know  what to expect with modern art! In contrast, traditional art can be pretty boring and repetitive, it does  not excite me at all. I just wish there were more modern art galleries in China. 

**Did you do much art when you were a child? **

> I did not do a lot of art when I was a child. I did not grow up in a very creative household and my  parents encouraged me to study more rather than engage in painting, crafts, or drawing. So, I hardly  did much art at all while I was growing up. 

>I was always doing art when I was a child! I did all sorts of different art. I used to love drawing and  painting. Then when I got older, I started getting into more complicated forms of art such as pottery  and collage making. Most weeks I would end up making some kind of amateur artwork. 

**Do you want to be an artist? **

> No, I don’t think I would like to be an artist. I do not think I have the personality or sense of creative  inspiration that is needed to become a talented artist. It seems like a lot of pressure to me. Moreover, I  believe that most people who attempt to become artists are not very successful and end up very poor. 

> I would love to be an artist; I think they are the coolest people! Artists are cool, creative, and  thoughtful people and I would love to be somebody like that. I believe it would be a lot of fun to  spend my days in a studio coming up with new artworks and practicing different artistic techniques. 

**Would you go to an art gallery if you had time? **

> To be quite honest, I would not go to an art gallery if I had some free time. I know this opinion may  seem uncultured, but I find most art galleries to be boring. I would much rather spend my free time at  the cinema or at a good restaurant with my friends. 

> Whenever I have the time, I try to visit art galleries. I think passing an afternoon in an art gallery is a  great use of time. Not only do you learn about different artists and art history, but you can also  become inspired by the beautiful artworks you see around you. You never know what sort of  experience you will have in an art gallery. 

### Music

**What kind of music do you enjoy? **

> My favourite type of music is classical music. I think classical music is the perfect form of music. It  is so precise, well-crafted, and elegant. I frequently listen to classical composers such as Bach,  Chopin, and Mozart. But I also like modern classical musicians such as Tan Dun and Chen Yi. 

> My favourite type of music if K-pop and J-pop. I got into this type of music when I was younger and  first downloaded TikTok. So many TikTok’s would be made using the music of groups like BTS and I  thought the vocals and the beats where incredible! 

**Is there any kind of music that you don't enjoy very much? **

> Yes, there are a few genres of music that I really don’t enjoy very much at all. All of my friends have  started listening to K-Pop and J-Pop. I find this type of music boring and irritating and it frustrates me  how much I have to hear it. It is in commercials, TV shows, and my friends play it all the time. 

> To be honest, I like most genres of music. I think there is something to be enjoyed in all genres of  music. Sometimes certain genres just have to be listened to in the right mood. For example, classical  music when you are sad or relaxed and rap music when you are angry. Though, to be honest, I don’t  really like jazz music. 

**Are there any musicians you would like to see in a live concert?**

>Ever since I was a small child it has been my absolute dream to go see the Shanghai Symphony  Orchestra. Not too long ago Xiaogang Ye performed ‘Songs of the Earth’ and apparently it was a  brilliant and unforgettable performance. One night at the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra would bring  me a lifetime of joy. 

> I have always wanted to see BTS perform a live concert. The thing about a BTS performance is that  so much money goes into the production and the performance. They always have the best lighting,  the best visual effects, and the best choreography money can buy! But tickets are so expensive I don’t  know if I will ever be able to go. 

**Have you always listened to the same kind of music as your friends? **

> No, I have never really listened to the same kind of music as my friends. Throughout school and in  my adult life I have always stood out as having a strange and uncommon music taste. Most of my  friends listen to more modern and popular music. 

> Yes, for the most part I have always listened to the same kind of music as my friends. It isn’t really  surprising, my friends and I watch the same TV shows, use the same social media, and go to the same  places so we are all exposed to the same types of music. 

### Chocolate

**How often do you eat chocolate? **

> I must admit a vice of mine, I have a very sweet tooth. I think I probably eat chocolate at least every  day, sometimes I eat it multiple times a day. There are so many different types of chocolate and  almost all of them taste delicious to me! I know it is a bad habit but I just can’t control myself. 

> AnnaYasi, Compared to most people, I eat chocolate very infrequently. I have never particularly had  a taste for desserts and sweet foods. I much prefer savoury and umami flavours. So, I only each  chocolate every once in a while when the opportunity arises. 

**Have you ever given someone chocolate as a present? **

> I have often used chocolate as a gift to give to people on special occasions and times of celebration.  I think chocolate makes an excellent gift because everybody loves chocolate! It is far less  complicated than presents such as nice watches, new clothes, books, or gadgets, of which it is very  easy to accidentally buy someone a gift they do not like! 

> No, I have never used chocolate as a gift before. Personally, I think a box of chocolates is a pretty  bad gift. Giving somebody chocolates is so impersonal and lazy. Anyone can give somebody a box  of chocolates. If I am going to give someone a present, I would put more thought in and gift  something personal to them. 

**Did you like chocolate when you were younger? **

> Yes, when I was a child I adored chocolate! I could never get enough of it! My parents would use  chocolate as a reward for me completing my homework or helping them with chores. I was always  trying to find more housework in the hopes of receiving chocolate as a reward. 

> No, I never much cared for chocolate when I was a child. Most children love chocolate and cannot  get enough of it, but I was different. I would much rather have some fresh fruit for dessert than a  chocolate cake or pudding. I always found the chocolate far too rich! 

**Why is chocolate so popular in many parts of the world? **

> I think chocolate is so popular in many parts of the world because it is versatile and has such a  unique flavour. On the one hand, there are all different sorts of chocolate and ways of preparing it.  From simple bars of chocolate to truffles and moose. On the other hand, chocolate is such a unique  blend of bitter and sweet that there is nothing that compares to it! 

> Personally, I think chocolate is so popular all over the world mainly because it is overrated.  Chocolate is not actually that good. The only reason we eat it everywhere is because it was a product  of colonialism. When Europe colonized the Americas, they exported huge amounts of chocolate and  sold it as a luxury item. That is why it is so popular everywhere. 

### Staying up late

**Do you often go to bed very late? **

> I must admit, I have a bad habit of staying up very late into the evenings. Sometimes I stay up late  because I have a big exam and I need to study. Sometimes I am just mindlessly scrolling on TikTok.  Whatever the case, I wake up tired and grumpy every time! 

> I have a very healthy sleep schedule and so I seldom go to bed very late. I am what they call an early  riser, so I am normally awake each day by 7:30am at the latest. This means that I get very tired in the  early evenings and I am normally asleep in bed by 9pm or 10pm! 

**Did you stay up late when you were a child? **

> Yes, I used to stay up late when I was a child. I was quite rebellious and I always hated going to bed!  But even when my parents sent me to my bedroom, I would stay up late into the night reading and  playing games. I would always feel so restless and excited when the sun started going down. So, I  could never go to sleep early. 

> No, I never used to stay up late when I was a child. I had very strict parents when I was growing up  and my bedtime was one of the things that was non-negotiable. As soon as it was 8pm I was supposed  to be asleep, in bed, with the lights out. Anna, So, Yasi, I would normally go up to bed a little earlier  than that to keep my parents happy. 

**How do you feel the next morning after a late night? **

> To be honest, after a late night I do not feel the worst. I know some people who are miserable after a  late night, or who cannot concentrate and become easily irritated all day. For me, I am just a little  sleepy and maybe a bit grumpy until I get a mug of tea or a cup of coffee! 

> I feel horrendous the next morning when I have not had a proper night’s sleep. If I have a late night, I  am miserable and I cannot focus on anything all day. I lose all productivity and become frustrated at  the slightest inconveniences. 

**What do you like to do when you stay up late? **

> When I stay up late my favourite thing to do is to watch my favourite TV programs or play on apps  like TikTok or Honor of Kings. I have some friends who also stay up late and sometimes we play  games together or chat to each other late into the night. I work and study very hard during the day so  in the evening I like to relax and entertain myself. 

> When I do stay up late, I like to do something relaxing such as listening to music or reading. Even if I  am not going to sleep, I still get very tired in the late evenings and so I cannot do anything strenuous  or too engaging. That is why reading or listening to music are perfect late-night activities for me. 

### Libraries

**How often do you visit a library? **

> I visit the library very frequently. I am in the middle of my studies at university and I am constantly  writing essays, studying for exams, and learning new materials. Therefore, I am in the library almost  every day doing something related to my studies. My friends tell me I practically live there! 

> I do not visit the library very often at all. To be quite honest, I am not that much of a bookworm. I  find reading tedious and boring. Therefore, spending time in the library is my idea of hell! I would go  as far as to say I actively avoid the library at all costs. 

**Do you like to work in a library? **

> I could see myself working for a library sometime in the future. On the one hand, I am a studious  person and I like reading books, so a library is my idea of heaven! On the other hand, libraries are  very relaxing places and the job is not stressful. That sounds like a good deal to me. 

> Working in a library is one of my least favourite things to do. I find the atmosphere in a library very  oppressive. It is always so silent and the energy in the air is quite tense. This makes me  uncomfortable and I find I work quite poorly in most libraries. 

**Did you use a library more when you were younger? **

> I did not use a library more when I was younger. To be honest, when I was growing up I spent most  of my time watching TV or playing video games with my friends. I did not read a lot as a kid, so I did  not spend a lot of time in libraries. Now that I am a student, I spend far more time in libraries. 

> I would say that I used libraries a lot more frequently when I was younger. When I was a kid, the  library was a fun place where I could discover a new picture book or children’s book and relax with it.  So, I went to the library a lot. Nowadays, the only thing I do in the library is study, so I do not want to  go there as often. 

**How common is it for children to visit libraries in your country? **

> I think it is very usual for children to visit libraries in my country. In China we have a strong culture  of hard work and self-improvement, this is first taught to us when we are children. So, many parents  will often take their children to libraries to foster good reading habits and encourage them to study. 

> It is not all that common for children to visit libraries in my country. Nowadays, most kids spend their  time playing mobile games on their phone or watching TV. Children do not want to spend time  reading and certainly do not want to spend time in libraries anymore.
